Based on the principle of moment balance, an input nonaffine nonlinear dynamics model of the bicycle robot is established. A driving velocity condition is proposed to maintain the robot balance. The nonaffine nonlinear system is transformed into an affine nonlinear system by defining the equivalent control. Subsequently, a feedback linearization controller is designed for the equivalent control. We design a combined control algorithm of synchronous policy iteration based on the actor–critic architecture. The actor neural network (NN) is designed based on the feedback linearization control law. Weight tuning laws for the critic and actor NNs are proposed. The system closed-loop stability and convergence of the NN weights are guaranteed based on the Lyapunov analysis. The optimality of the equivalent control policy is guaranteed. To satisfy the driving velocity condition, the values of the steering angle and driving velocity are determined based on the optimal equivalent control.

A set of features is extracted from the dynamics model of a bicycle robot.

An index describing the importance of features is designed based on the maximal information coefficient (MIC). The features are ranked using the feature importance index.

The penalty term of BIC is constructed with the number of both the features and weight parameters in the recurrent high order neural network (RHONN) model.

Fresh blood may appear during the haematoma drainage process, so this needs to be observed and detected in real time. To solve this problem, this paper studies images produced during the haematoma drainage process. A blood image feature selection recognition and classification framework is designed. First, aiming at the characteristics of the small colour differences in blood images, the general RGB colour space feature is not obvious. This study proposes an optimal colour channel selection method. By extracting the colour information from the images, it is recombined into a 3 × 3 matrix. The normalised 4-neighbourhood contrast and variance are calculated for quantitative comparison. The optimised colour channel is selected to overcome the problem of weak features caused by a single colour space. After that, the effective region in the image is intercepted, and the best colour channel of the image in the region is transformed. The first, second and third moments of the three best colour channels are extracted to form a nine-dimensional eigenvector. K-means clustering is used to obtain the image eigenvector, outliers are removed, and the results are then transferred to the hidden Markov model (HMM) and support vector machine (SVM) for classification. After selecting the best color channel, the classification accuracy of HMM-SVM is greatly improved. Compared with other classification algorithms, the proposed method offers great advantages. Experiments show that the recognition accuracy of this method reaches 98.9%. © 2022 The Authors.","tags":["Blood;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Hidden Markov models;Image classification;K-means clustering;RGB color model;Vector spaces;"],"title":"Classification and detection using hidden Markov modelsupport vector machine algorithm based on optimal colour space selection for blood images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lei Guo","Han Zhao","Yuan Song"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"ee0779d90348dd2f0273cdc098c62d79","permalink":"https://glbupt.github.io/publication/guo-2021-b/","publishdate":"2024-01-31T12:39:00.301821Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-2021-b/","section":"publication","summary":"The problem we focus on in this paper is to find a nearly optimal sliding mode controller of continuous-time nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems that can both reduce chattering and minimize the cost function, which is a measure of the performance index of dynamics systems. First, the deficiency of chattering in traditional SMC and the quasi-SMC method are analyzed in this paper. In quasi-SMC, the signum function of the traditional SMC is replaced with a continuous saturation function. Then, a chattering reduction algorithm based on integral reinforcement learning (IRL) is proposed. Under an initial sliding mode controller, the proposed method can learn the nearly optimal saturation function using policy iteration. To satisfy the requirement of the learned saturation function, we treat the problem of training the saturation function as the constraint of an optimization problem. The online neural network implementation of the proposed algorithm is presented based on symmetric radius basis functions and a regularized batch least-squares (BLS) algorithm to train the control law in this paper. Finally, two examples are simulated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The second example is an application to a real-world dynamics model—a two-wheeled variable structure robot.

With the development of robotic research, many new requirements, such as low speed and heavy load, have been proposed for the design of gear reducers used in the joints. To meet these challenges, here, we present the design of a new gear reducer based on a spherical motion sub-lever drive mechanism. Our lever-based gear reducer can transmit the speed and torque from the input shaft to the output shaft through a fixed-axis gear train transmission, lever transmission, and internal translational gear transmission. Compared with traditional gear reducers, our lever-based reducer has stronger load capacities and is suitable for low-speed and heavy-load scenarios. The design parameters of the lever drive mechanism were optimized via finite element analysis and a genetic algorithm, and the assembly of the lever drive mechanism was further simplified. We found the dimensions of the lever are critical for improving the overall performance of this reducer. In addition, the transmission ability of this reducer was demonstrated by a physical prototype. This reducer will find many applications in robotic joints, cranes, and mine hoists. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Therefore, when some sensors are applied in dynamic systems, their output signals are often submerged in the noise signals generated by translation. To enhance the ability of tilt sensors to resist translational noise, a dynamic tilt sensor is proposed based on the principle of variable reluctance from the perspective of sensor structure. The eccentric structure of the sensor constructed with a shell, liquid, and internal damping plate was designed according to the principles of mechanics. The characteristic of translational acceleration restraint determined by the sensor structure was established theoretically. In addition, the magnetic circuit of the sensor was analyzed to illustrate the sensor’s working principles. A Clapp oscillator circuit was designed to convert mechanical motion into a measureable electrical signal. A method to determine the sensor’s direction of rotation is proposed. A waveform conversion circuit was designed to convert the sine wave output of the Clapp oscillator to a square wave, and a square-wave frequency measurement circuit was designed based on the C8051 micro-control unit. A translation–rotation experimental hardware platform was constructed. The data acquisition program was designed on a PC platform, and the translation–rotation experiments were conducted with an MTi attitude measurement unit as a reference. The validity of the tilt angle measurements and the effect of the translational acceleration restraint of the sensor were verified by the experimental data. The theoretical results obtained were consistent with the experimental data, verifying the validity of the theoretical analysis and experimental devices employed. A measurement range of −180 to 180° was achieved. © 2019 by the authors.

Their name comes from the manner in which tightrope walkers maintain their balance by rolling or moving a pole from left to right.

This structure consists of a rotational pole and a translational pole coupled with each other in a parallelogram. The robot is an underactuated system. A dynamic model of the robot is established here based on the Lagrange method, and the controller of the system was designed using a partial feedback linearization control algorithm.
