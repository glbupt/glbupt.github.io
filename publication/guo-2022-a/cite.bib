Fresh blood may appear during the haematoma drainage process, so this needs to be observed and detected in real time. To solve this problem, this paper studies images produced during the haematoma drainage process. A blood image feature selection recognition and classification framework is designed. First, aiming at the characteristics of the small colour differences in blood images, the general RGB colour space feature is not obvious. This study proposes an optimal colour channel selection method. By extracting the colour information from the images, it is recombined into a 3 &times; 3 matrix. The normalised 4-neighbourhood contrast and variance are calculated for quantitative comparison. The optimised colour channel is selected to overcome the problem of weak features caused by a single colour space. After that, the effective region in the image is intercepted, and the best colour channel of the image in the region is transformed. The first, second and third moments of the three best colour channels are extracted to form a nine-dimensional eigenvector. K-means clustering is used to obtain the image eigenvector, outliers are removed, and the results are then transferred to the hidden Markov model (HMM) and support vector machine (SVM) for classification. After selecting the best color channel, the classification accuracy of HMM-SVM is greatly improved. Compared with other classification algorithms, the proposed method offers great advantages. Experiments show that the recognition accuracy of this method reaches 98.9%.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 The Authors.},
