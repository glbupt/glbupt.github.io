 abstract = {The 90 degrees stand motion of a Front-wheel drive bicycle robot is analyzed in this paper. A kind of dynamic model is presented based on Routh Equation. The linear dynamic modelling of the bicycle robot was presented after the linearization by ignoring the effects of the high-order terms and the multiplications of coupling terms. According to 90 degrees stand motion control, the controller was designed based on LMI H<inf>&infin;</inf> robust control algorithm, on this basis, the simulation of the controller for the stand motion of the robot without interference and under interference is presented separately. The validity of the control algorithm is testified by the simulation. It has certain ability of anti-interference, the real prototype was built, it could lay a foundation for the control of the robot prototype.<br/> &copy; 2016 IEEE.},
