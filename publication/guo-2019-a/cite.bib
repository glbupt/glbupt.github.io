 abstract = {Tilt angle measurement in dynamic systems is problematic because the rotation of the measured platform is coupled with translation. Therefore, when some sensors are applied in dynamic systems, their output signals are often submerged in the noise signals generated by translation. To enhance the ability of tilt sensors to resist translational noise, a dynamic tilt sensor is proposed based on the principle of variable reluctance from the perspective of sensor structure. The eccentric structure of the sensor constructed with a shell, liquid, and internal damping plate was designed according to the principles of mechanics. The characteristic of translational acceleration restraint determined by the sensor structure was established theoretically. In addition, the magnetic circuit of the sensor was analyzed to illustrate the sensor&rsquo;s working principles. A Clapp oscillator circuit was designed to convert mechanical motion into a measureable electrical signal. A method to determine the sensor&rsquo;s direction of rotation is proposed. A waveform conversion circuit was designed to convert the sine wave output of the Clapp oscillator to a square wave, and a square-wave frequency measurement circuit was designed based on the C8051 micro-control unit. A translation&ndash;rotation experimental hardware platform was constructed. The data acquisition program was designed on a PC platform, and the translation&ndash;rotation experiments were conducted with an MTi attitude measurement unit as a reference. The validity of the tilt angle measurements and the effect of the translational acceleration restraint of the sensor were verified by the experimental data. The theoretical results obtained were consistent with the experimental data, verifying the validity of the theoretical analysis and experimental devices employed. A measurement range of &minus;180 to 180&deg; was achieved.<br/> &copy; 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},
