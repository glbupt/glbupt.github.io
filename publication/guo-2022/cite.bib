 abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Aiming at the difference between a bicycle robot dynamics model based on prior knowledge and a real robot, the robot modeling problem is studied. A set of features is extracted from the dynamics model of a bicycle robot. The trigonometric functions in the features are replaced with a linear combination of several sigmoid functions to form a new set of features. An index describing the importance of features is designed based on the maximal information coefficient (MIC). The features are ranked using the feature importance index. The index of system identification fitness (FIT) is regarded as the likelihood function term in Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The penalty term of BIC is constructed with the number of both the features and weight parameters in the recurrent high order neural network (RHONN) model. A semi-empirical dynamics modeling method based on feature selection is proposed. An inverse optimal controller is designed to stabilize the bicycle robot. The effectiveness of the modeling method is verified through simulation and real robot experiments.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier B.V.},
