 abstract = {A kind of unicycle robot was designed. The mechanical structure can be divided into pitching subsystem and yaw subsystem. A kind of dynamic model was proposed based on Appell Equations. And the linear dynamic model of the unicycle robot was presented by the means of the linearization, ignoring the effects of the high-order items and the multiplications of coupling items. And a sliding mode controller was designed for the linear pitching subsystem. The Adams-Matlab simulation experiment was completed. The validity of the dynamic model and the controller were testified. The prototype of the robot was built. &copy; 2017 Technical Committee on Control Theory, CAA.},
