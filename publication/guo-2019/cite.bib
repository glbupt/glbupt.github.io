 abstract = {The variable structure two-wheeled robot (VSTWR) is a nonlinear system. The dynamic model between the VSTWR during the mode switching process of Segway mode and Bicycle mode is proposed in the paper. According to kinematic and energy analysis, dynamical models based on Appell equations and Chaplygin equations are built respectively. The computer numerical simulation based on Matlab is achieved. And the validity of the two dynamic models are testified by the simulation.<br/> &copy; 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},
