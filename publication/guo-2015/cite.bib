 abstract = {A wire-moving robot which can keep self-balancing through the control of balancing pole is analyzed in this paper. After kinematic and energy analysis, the nonlinear dynamic model is presented based on Routh method. To achieve the goal of self-balancing, a kind of cascade sliding mode controller is designed. The stability of the system is proved based on Lyapunov theorem. The computer simulation is achieved by the Matlab software, and the validity of both the dynamic model and the controller is verified based on the simulation results. The results also show that the controller has good ability of signal tracking and anti-interference.<br/> &copy; 2015 IEEE.},
