 abstract = {A kind of dynamic model was proposed based on Appell equations. And the sliding mode controller was designed for the unicycle robot. The dynamic model of the unicycle robot was presented after the linearization, by ignoring the effects of the high-order terms and the multiplications of coupling terms. And the computer simulation including the controller for the pitching, the rolling and the yaw subsystem is presented separately. Simulation results show that the controller of three subsystems could achieve self-balancing after a transient period of time.<br/> &copy; 2016 IEEE.},
