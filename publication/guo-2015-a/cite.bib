 abstract = {The wire-walking robot is a typical nonlinear and non-minimum phase system. A wire-moving robot based on the control of balancing pole is analyzed in this paper. According to kinematic and energy analysis, a dynamical model based on Appell Equations is built. To achieve the goal of self-balance, the controller based on feedback linearization and adaptive sliding mode control algorithm is proposed. Center manifold theory is introduced for stabilization of the system. The computer simulation based on MATLAB is achieved. And the validity of the dynamic model and the control algorithm are testified by the simulation results. The simulation results also show that the controller has good ability of signal tracking and anti-interference. &copy; 2015 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},
