 abstract = {Petri net is a widely applied tool, and is very efficient in the area of network protocol modeling. A method for modeling and simulating Modbus protocol is proposed in the paper based on Petri net. According to the Modbus protocol data frame state machine, the corresponding Petri net structure model is presented. The Petri model is described with Petri net graphics and formal language. Meanwhile, and the Petri net reachability graph analysis method is applied to analyze the Petri net model of Modbus protocol, the properties of Modbus protocol model is verified. This modeling method has both good intuitiveness and reliability analysis for Modbus protocol.<br/> &#x00A9; 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},
